\item{a)} Replace $\A$ by a \jumplink{3.4.variant}{variant}.
\item{b)} Replace a part $\neg Q\x\B$ of $\A$ by $Q'\x\neg\B$, where 
$Q'\x$ is $\forall\x$ if $Q\x$ is $\exists\x$, and $Q'\x$ is $\exists\x$
if $Q\x$ is $\forall\x$.
\item{c)} Replace a part $Q\x\B \lor \C$ of $\A$ by $Q\x(\B \lor \C)$,
provided that $\x$ is not free in $\C$.
\item{d)} Replace a part $\B \lor Q\x\C$ of $\A$ by $Q\x(\B \lor \C)$,
provided that $\x$ is not free in $\B$.

Additional operations to avoid eliminating $\to$ and $\land$ as defined symbols: 
\item{e)} Replace a part $Q\x\B \to \C$ of $\A$ by $Q'\x(\B \to \C)$,
where $Q'\x$ is as in (b), provided that $\x$ is not free in $\C$.
\item{f)} Replace a part $\B \to Q\x\C$ of $\A$ by $Q\x(\B \to \C)$,
provided that $\x$ is not free in $\B$.
\item{g)} Replace a part $Q\x\B \land \C$ of $\A$ by $Q\x(\B \land \C)$,
provided that $\x$ is not free in $\C$.
\item{h)} Replace a part $\B \land Q\x\C$ of $\A$ by $Q\x(\B \land \C)$,
provided that $\x$ is not free in $\B$.
