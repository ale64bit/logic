\beginsection EXERCISES

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ans 1. Let's prove it by induction on theorems (as in \S3.1).
If $\A$ is a theorem provable without use of substitution axioms, 
identity axioms, equality axioms, nonlogical axioms or the $\exists$-introduction 
rule, then it is a tautological consequence of some theorems $\B_1, \dots, \B_n$.
If $n=0$, then $\A$ is a tautology, since it's a tautological consequence of the
empty sequence of formulas. Otherwise, by the induction hypothesis, if 
$\B_1, \dots, \B_n$ can be proven without the use of substitution axioms, identity 
axioms, equality axioms, nonlogical axioms or the $\exists$-introduction rule, 
they are also tautologies. This means that $V(\B_i) = \top$ for all $i$ and truth
valuations $V$, which implies that $V(\A) = \top$ for all truth valuations and thus
$\A$ is also a tautology.
\medskip

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ans 2. First note, that if a formula $\A$ is a tautology, then it's a tautological 
consequence of any set of formulas $\Gamma$ since $V(\A) = \top$ for every truth 
valuation $V$. We use induction on theorems (as in \S3.1):
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ is an identity axiom $\x = \x$, then $\A^*$ is $\e = \e$ 
which is a tautological consequence of $\e = \e$.
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ is an equality axiom 
$$\x_1 = \y_1 \to \cdots \to \x_n = \y_n \to \f\x_1 \dots \x_n = \f\y_1 \dots \y_n,$$
then $\A^*$ is 
$$\e = \e \to \cdots \to \e = \e \to \e = \e,$$
which is a tautology.
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ is an equality axiom 
$$\x_1 = \y_1 \to \cdots \to \x_n = \y_n \to \p\x_1 \dots \x_n \to \p\y_1 \dots \y_n,$$
then $\A^*$ is 
$$\e = \e \to \cdots \to \e = \e \to \p\e \dots \e \to \p\e \dots \e,$$
which is a tautology.
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ is a substitution axiom $\B_\x[\a] \to \exists\x\B$, then 
$\A^*$ is $(\B_\x[\a])^* \to \B^*$. First, let's show that $(\B_\x[\a])^*$ and $\B^*$ 
are the same, by induction on the length of $\B$:
\itemitem{$\circ$} If $\B$ is an atomic formula $\p\a_1 \dots \a_n$, then any occurrence 
of $\x$ in $\B$ is completely inside one of the $\a_i$. Hence, both $(\B_\x[\a])^*$ and 
$\B^*$ are $\p\e \dots \e$.
\itemitem{$\circ$} If $\B$ is $\neg \C$, then $(\B_\x[\a])^*$ is $\neg (\C_\x[\a])^*$,
$\B^*$ is $\neg \C^*$, and $(\C_\x[\a])^*$ and $\C^*$ are the same by the induction 
hypothesis.
\itemitem{$\circ$} If $\B$ is $\C \lor \D$, then $(\B_\x[\a])^*$ is $(\C_\x[\a])^* \lor (\D_\x[\a])^*$
and $\B^*$ is $\C^* \lor \D^*$. Finally, $(\C_\x[\a])^*$ and $\C^*$ are the same, and
$(\D_\x[\a])^*$ and $\D^*$ are the same, by the induction hypothesis.
\itemitem{$\circ$} Suppose $\B$ is $\exists\y\C$: if $\x$ and $\y$ are the same, then
obviously $\B_\x[\a]$ and $\B$ are the same since $\B$ has no free occurrences of $\x$.
Otherwise, $(\B_\x[\a])^*$ is $(\C_\x[\a])^*$, $\B^*$ is $\C^*$, and $(\C_\x[\a])^*$ and
$\C^*$ are the same by the induction hypothesis.

Hence, $\A^*$ is $\B^* \to \B^*$ which is a tautology.
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ was obtained from $\B \to \C$ by the $\exists$-introduction rule,
then $\A$ is $\exists\x\B \to \C$, $\A^*$ is $\B^* \to \C^*$, and $\B^* \to \C^*$ is 
a tautological consequence of $\e = \e$ by the induction hypothesis.
\item{$\bullet$} If $\A$ is a tautological consequence of formulas $\B_1, \dots, \B_n$, 
then the $\B_1^*, \dots, \B_n^*$ are tautological consequences of $\e=\e$ by the
induction hypothesis. Hence, $\A^*$ is a tautological consequence of 
$\B_1^*, \dots, \B_n^*$ (see the {\it Remark} in \S3.1, page 30), so $\A^*$ is also
a tautological consequence of $\e = \e$.

Now, let's assume that there is a formula $\A$ such that $\vdash_{T} \A$ and $\vdash_{T} \neg \A$.
Using the result just proved, the first condition implies that $\A^*$ is a tautological
consequence of $\e=\e$ and the second condition implies that $\neg \A^*$ is also a 
tautological consequence of $\e=\e$. Hence, for any truth valuation $V$ such that 
$V(\e=\e) = \top$, we must have $V(\A^*) = \top$ and $V(\neg \A^*) = \neg V(\A^*) = \top$.
This is a contradiction. Thus, there is no such formula.

This result is interesting, since it basically says that we can not prove two theorems 
that contradict each other in $T$.

\ans 3. 

\ansitem (a)
Let $\x_1, \dots, \x_n$ the free variables of $\forall\x(\A \to \B)$ and $\exists\x\A \to \exists\x\B$; 
let $T'$ be a theory obtained from $T$ by adding $n$ new constants $\e_1, \dots, \e_n$; 
let $\C$ be $\forall\x(\A \to \B)$ and let $\D$ be $\exists\x\A \to \exists\x\B$.
Note that
$$
\vdash_T \C \to \D \quad\hbox{iff}\quad \vdash_{T'} \C[\e_1, \dots, \e_n] \to \D[\e_1, \dots, \e_n]
$$
by the Theorem on Constants, and
$$
\vdash_{T'} \C[\e_1, \dots, \e_n] \to \D[\e_1, \dots, \e_n] \quad\hbox{iff}\quad \vdash_{T'[\C[\e_1, \dots, \e_n]]} \D[\e_1, \dots, \e_n] 
$$
by the Deduction Theorem. Hence, in $T'[\C[\e_1, \dots, \e_n]]$, we have
\item{} $\vdash \C[\e_1, \dots, \e_n]$ \hfill [the added nonlogical axiom]
\item{} $\vdash \forall\x(\A[\e_1, \dots, \e_n] \to \B[\e_1, \dots, \e_n])$ \hfill [by the definition of $\C$]

Then, consider the formula

$$
The left side says {\it ``there is a number which is equal to zero and there is

which is both equal to zero and greater than zero"}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ans 6. 

\ansitem (a) 
\itemitem{} $\vdash \A \to \exists\x\exists\y\A$ \hfill [Substitution Theorem]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \exists\x\A \to \exists\x\exists\y\A$ \hfill [$\exists$-Introduction Rule]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \exists\y\exists\x\A \to \exists\x\exists\y\A$ \hfill [$\exists$-Introduction Rule]

The reverse implication is obtained in a similar fashion. Note that it is also possible to obtain 
$\exists\y\exists\x\A$ as a variant of $\exists\x\exists\y\A$: first obtain $\exists\x\exists\x'\A'$
where $\A'=\A_y[\x']$ and $\x'$ is a new variable not appearing in $\A$; then obtain $\exists\y\exists\x'\A'_\x[\y]$ 
and finally $\exists\y\exists\x\A$ by substituting $\x'$ to $\x$. This would imply the result by the
Variant Theorem.

\ansitem (b)
\itemitem{} $\vdash \forall\x\forall\y\A \to \A$ \hfill [Substitution Theorem]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \forall\x\forall\y\A \to \forall\x\A$ \hfill [$\forall$-Introduction Rule]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \forall\x\forall\y\A \to \forall\y\forall\x\A$ \hfill [$\forall$-Introduction Rule]

The reverse implication is obtained in a similar fashion.

\ansitem (c)
\itemitem{} $\vdash \A \to \exists\x\A$ \hfill [Substitution Theorem]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \forall\y\A \to \forall\y\exists\x\A$ \hfill [Distribution Rule]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \exists\x\forall\y\A \to \forall\y\exists\x\A$ \hfill [$\exists$-Introduction Rule]

Note that it might seem that using the dual results in the above proof, the opposite implication could be
obtained (i.e. $\vdash \forall\y\exists\x\A \to \exists\x\forall\y\A$). However this is not the case, as
they result in an alternative proof of the same result as above:

\itemitem{} $\vdash \forall\y\A \to \A$ \hfill [Substitution Theorem]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \exists\x\forall\y\A \to \exists\x\A$ \hfill [Distribution Rule]
\itemitem{} $\vdash \exists\x\forall\y\A \to \forall\y\exists\x\A$ \hfill [$\forall$-Introduction Rule]

\ansitem (d) Consider the formula
$$\forall x \exists y (Sx = y) \to \exists y \forall x (Sx = y).$$
The left side can be interpreted as {\it ``every number has a successor"}, while the
right side can be interpreted as {\it ``there is a number that is the successor of every number"}.
