\item{1.} Reduce the characterization of $T[\Gamma]$ to that of $T$ (\jumplink{Reduction Theorem}{Reduction Theorem}).
\item{2.} Reduce the validity form of the \jumplink{Completeness Theorem}{Completeness Theorem} to the consistency form.
\item{3.} Show that the restriction of a model $\SA' | L(T)$ is a model of $T$; so if we
obtain a model for an extension, we also obtain a model for the base theory.
\item{4.} Given a consistent theory $T$ we need to find a model via syntactical means.
\item{5.} Let the theorems of $T$ say what is truth of the variable-free terms, which
denote individuals.
\item{6.} Introduce the canonical structure $\SA$ (also called the {\it term structure})
using the equivalence classes of variable-free terms as individuals.
\item{7.} Show that the atomic closed formulas are valid in the canonical structure
iff they are theorems.
\item{8.} The two obstacles for showing that the same applies to general closed formulas
are:
\itemitem{(i)} There might be not enough variable-free terms.
\itemitem{(ii)} There might be formulas which are undecidable.
\item{9.} To handle (i), Henkin theories are introduced which guarantee that a constant
exists for every closed instantiation (also called the {\it witness property}).
\item{10.} Show that if $T$ is a complete Henkin theory, then the canonical structure
for $T$, is a model of $T$.
\item{11.} Show that we can construct a Henkin theory $T_c$ from a consistent theory $T$
using the special constants and axioms, and that $T_c$ is a conservative extension of $T$.
\item{12.} Show that every consistent theory has a simple complete extension (\jumplink{Lindenbaum's Theorem}{Lindenbaum's Theorem}).
