A collection of my notes and programs while studying mathematical logic independently, 
mostly following Shoenfield's _Mathematical Logic_ [text](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Logic-Addison-Wesley-Joseph-Shoenfield/dp/1568811357).

Related to my other notes and tools in [kaktusat](https://github.com/ale64bit/kaktusat).
