\beginsection DEFINITIONS

\item{$\bullet$} A formula is {\it elementary} if it is either atomic or an instantiation.

\item{$\bullet$} A {\it truth valuation} for $T$ is a mapping from the set of elementary 
formulas in $T$ to the set of truth values.

\item{$\bullet$} $\B$ is a {\it tautological consequence} of $\A_1, \dots , \A_n$ 
if $V(\B) = \top$ for every truth valuation $V$ such that 
$V(\A_1) = \cdots = V(\A_n) = \top$.

\item{$\bullet$} A formula $\A$ is a {\it tautology} it is a tautological consequence of 
the empty sequence of formulas, i.e. if $V(\A) = \top$ for every truth valuation $V$.

\beginsection RESULTS

\noindent {\bf \S3.1}

\proclaim Tautology Theorem. If $\B$ is a tautological consequence of $\A_1, \dots, \A_n$,
and $\vdash\A_1, \dots, \vdash \A_n$, then $\vdash \B$.

\proclaim Corollary. Every tautology is a theorem.

\proclaim Lemma 1. If $\vdash \A \lor \B$, then $\vdash \B \lor \A$.

\proclaim Detachment Rule. If $\vdash \A$ and $\vdash \A \to \B$, then $\vdash \B$.

\proclaim Corollary. If $\vdash \A_1, \dots, \vdash \A_n$, and $\vdash \A_1 \to \dots \to \A_n \to \B$, then $\vdash \B$.

\proclaim Lemma 2. If $n \ge 2$, and $\A_1 \lor \cdots \lor \A_n$ is a tautology, then $\vdash \A_1 \lor \cdots \lor \A_n$.

\noindent {\bf \S3.2}

\proclaim $\forall$-Introduction Rule. If $\vdash \A \to \B$ and $\x$ is not free in $\A$, then $\vdash \A \to \forall\x\B$.

\proclaim Generalization Rule. If $\vdash \A$, then $\vdash \forall\x\A$.

\proclaim Substitution Rule. If $\vdash \A$ and $\A'$ is an instance of $\A$, then $\vdash \A'$.

\proclaim Substitution Theorem. 
$$\eqalign{&\vdash \A_{\x_1, \dots, \x_n}[\a_1, \dots, \a_n] \to \exists \x_1 \dots \exists \x_n \A\cr
&\vdash \forall \x_1 \dots \forall \x_n \A \to \A_{\x_1, \dots, \x_n}[\a_1, \dots, \a_n]}$$

\proclaim Distribution Rule. If $\vdash \A \to \B$, then $\vdash \exists\x\A \to \exists\x\B$ and $\vdash \forall\x\A \to \forall\x\B$.

\proclaim Closure Theorem. If $\A'$ is the closure of $\A$, then $\vdash \A'$ iff $\vdash \A$.

\proclaim Corollary. If $\A'$ is the closure of $\A$, then $\A'$ is valid in a structure $\cal A$ iff $\A$ is valid in $\cal A$.

\noindent {\bf \S3.3}

\proclaim Deduction Theorem. Let $\A$ be a closed formula in $T$. For every formula $\B$ of $T$, $\vdash_T \A \to \B$ iff $\B$ is a theorem of $T[\A]$.

\proclaim Corollary. Let $\A_1, \dots, \A_n$ be closed formulas in $T$. For every formula $\B$ in $T$, $\vdash_{T} \A_1 \to \cdots \to \A_n \to \B$ 
iff $\B$ is a theorem of $T[\A_1, \dots, \A_n]$.

\proclaim Theorem on Constants. Let $T'$ be obtained from $T$ by adding new constants (but no new nonlogical axioms).
For every formula $\A$ of $T$ and every sequence $\e_1, \dots, \e_n$ of distinct new constants, 
$\vdash_T \A$ iff $\vdash_{T'} \A[\e_1, \dots, \e_n]$.
