\beginsection DEFINITIONS

\item{$\bullet$} A formula is {\it elementary} if it is either atomic or an instantiation.

\item{$\bullet$} A {\it truth valuation} for $T$ is a mapping from the set of elementary 
formulas in $T$ to the set of truth values.

\item{$\bullet$} $\B$ is a {\it tautological consequence} of $\A_1, \dots , \A_n$ 
if $V(\B) = \top$ for every truth valuation $V$ such that 
$V(\A_1) = \cdots = V(\A_n) = \top$.

\item{$\bullet$} A formula $\A$ is a {\it tautology} it is a tautological consequence of 
the empty sequence of formulas, i.e. if $V(\A) = \top$ for every truth valuation $V$.

\beginsection RESULTS

\proclaim Tautology Theorem. If $\B$ is a tautological consequence of $\A_1, \dots, \A_n$,
and $\vdash\A_1, \dots, \vdash \A_n$, then $\vdash \B$.

\proclaim Corollary. Every tautology is a theorem.
